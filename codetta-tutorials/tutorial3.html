	<h1> Tutorial 3 - Timbre </h1>

	<!-- ====================================== cee9ea -->

	<div>
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p>
				Timbre is the character of a notes sound, excluding their pitch.
				
				<br><br>This tutorial will guide you through exploring "timbre" in Codetta.
			</p>
	</div>
	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Dynamics </h2>

		<p> 
			Dynamics refer to how loud or quiet notes are played. Imagine a volume control on your tv.
			
			<br><br><b>TASK: Recreate the screen shot below into Codetta. </b>
	
			<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture1.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

			<br><br>The dynamics (pink) block will set the volume of all the bars to the right of it, unless changed by another dynamic block. 
	
			<br><br>You can change the loudness of the dynamics by clicking on the drop down menu within the "dynamics block", and choosing one of the options.

			<br><br>Music has alot of terms, and it can get very hard remembering the names of all of the different things, especially when they match a multiude of different symbols. 
	
			<br><br>To help with this you can find the "info bar" at the bottom of Codetta (shown below). 
	
			<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture3.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

			<br><br>This displays alittle bit of information everytime you do something within Codetta - so looking at it can help you figure out what a "thing" does and it's correct name.
	
			<br><br><b> TASK: By looking at the info bar, try to figure out  the correct names for the "p" and "f" symbols and what they do. </b> 
		</p>
	
	
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Instruments </h2>
			<p>
				Another large aspect of timbre is choosing instruments. Lots of different instruments have many different charactersistics. 
				
				<br><br>Similarities and differences can be found between all of Codettas instruments.
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture4.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br>These can be found by going to the purple instruments tab in the toolbar.
				
				<br><br>All instruments are "start blocks" and work just like the "speaker block" we have been using so far.
				
				<br><br>I.e. instead of starting with the speaker block, pick an instrument to begin a stream of music.
		</p>
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> I See The Moon </h2>
			<p> 
				The best way to learn about the sounds of the different instruments is to start experimenting with them.
				
				<br><br><b> TASK: Copy out the nursery rhyme "I See The Moon" below.
				
				<br><br>The global tempo is 120 bpm!
				
				<br><br>Can you describe how each part is structured within the entire song, as you compose? </b> 
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture5.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:100%;"> 
			</p>				
		</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Improvisation </h2>
			<p> 
				Now that you have copied "I See The Moon" pick an instrument of your choice. 

				<br><br>Adding up to 8 different "2/4" blocks, compose your own accompaniying melody to the peice, however, only use the notes <b> G A B D </b> and <b> E </b>
				
				<br><br>To remind yourself of the pitch of each note, look at the "info bar" the letter after "Treble = " (circled in the picture below.)
