	<h1> Tutorial 4 - Pitch </h1>

	<!-- ======================================  -->

	<div>
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p>
				Pitch is how high or low a note sounds.
				
				<br><br>This tutorial will guide you though the other elements of pitch within Codetta.
			</p>
	</div>
	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Octaves </h2>
			<p> 
				<b>TASK: Recreate the screen shot below into Codetta, and press play. </b>

				<br><br>Both of these notes are <b> octaves </b> apart! This means that the notes have the same letter (C), but one sounds higher than the other. 
				
				<br><br><b>TASK: Look at the letters next to "Treble = " in the info bar. Which C has a 4 and which has a 5 mean? </b>

		<h2> Instrument Ranges </h2>
			<p>
				Let's look at two of Codettas instruments, the violin and the cello!
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut4Images/picture3.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br>The Violin is a small instrument, so when playing a C5, it sounds reasonable and not too silly. However, a big low sounding Cello may not be as effective as creating high pitched sounds.
				
				<br><br><b>TASK: try listening to both instruments. Which sounds better? </b>
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut4Images/picture4.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
			</p>
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Clefs </h2>
			<p>
				Let's try and change the notes of the cello to be at a much smarter pitch.
				
				<br><br>To do this we can select the "bass clef block" from the blue, pitch category in our toolbox.
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut4Images/picture5.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br>By adding it like in the image above, we change the pitches that the notes and lines on our stave (the "bar block") equal. Hence you should look at the "Bass = " value on the info bar.
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut4Images/picture6.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br>By default, we have been always using the treble clef, however, sometimes its good to add it anyway to make it super clear.
				
				<br><br><b>TASK: Recreate the screenshot below. What do all of the notes have in common? What do they have that is different.</b>
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut4Images/picture7.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

		<h2> Make Music! </h2>
			<p>
				You now have all the skills needed to make a really powerful and expressive piece of music.
				
				<br><br><b> Listen to the video demo below. This was made all with Codetta! </b>

				<br><br><iframe style="width:90%; height:90%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIcBU6dvRCU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<br><br>TASK: See if you too can recreate the music in the video - a screenshot is shown below for reference. 
				
				<br><br>NOTE: The global BPM is set to 45.
