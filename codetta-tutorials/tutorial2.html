	<h1> Tutorial 2 - Time </h1>

	<!-- ====================================== cee9ea -->

	<div>
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p>Time is one of the 3 key elements of music. This tutorial will explore how to manipulate time in Codetta.</p>
	</div>
	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Time Signatures  </h2>
			<p> 
				In the previous tutorial we connected many "four four bars" to our speaker block.

				<br><br>"Four four" is the blocks time signature, shown in the image above. 
				
				<br><br>This means that we can fill the bar using 4 crotchet notes (as 4 x 1/4 = 4/4). 			

				<br><br>Codetta has many other time signatures. Hence, different bars can be filled with different amounts of notes.
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture2.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br>For example, look at the three four bar above. This time only 3 crotchet notes can fill the bar (as 3 X 1/4 = 3/4).
				
				<br><br><b>TASK: How many two four blocks does it take, to last as long as a single four four bar? </b> 
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture3.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br><b>Hint: The picture above may be able to help you?</b>
			</p>
		<!-- </center>
			<p> 
				<ol> 
					<li> Add four speaker blocks to the workspace. </li>
					<li> Connect a bar with a different time signature to each of the speaker blocks. This will mean that they play at the same time. </li>
					<li> Fill all of the bars with crotchet notes. </li>
					<li> Make each bar have its own unique pitch for all of the notes within it. </li>
				</ol> 
			</p>
		<center>
			<p> Press play, and see if you can hear the different pitches, and notice when they are finsihed sounding. </p>
			<p> Can you hear the 5/4 bar all the way until the end? What about the 2/4 bar? </p>
			<p> Is it possible to count different bars as you go along? </p>

		<h2> Repeat Blocks</h2>
			<p> 
				Often in music we will want to repeat a musical idea over and over again. 

				<br><br>This is sometimes refered to as a <b>loop</b>. 

				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture4.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br>Above is an example of a repeating musical idea written in Codetta. Now dosen't that look irritating. Imagine having to rewrite the same notes over and over and over again
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture5.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
				
				<br><br><b> Navigate to the "Time" tab on our toolbar. </b>
				
				<br><br>This is where the repeat blocks are useful! By placing these either side of our bars, we can let Codetta know how many times to play the same thing.
				
				<br><br>Have a look at the same peice of music, this time written with repeat blocks. 
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture6.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
			</p>
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Tempo </h2>
			<p>
				Tempo is how fast or slow music is played.
				
				<br><br>We typically measure this by saying how many beats happen per minute i.e. our "beats per minute" (BPM).
				
				<br><br><b> Find the global tempo widget in the top right of the program. </b>
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture8-new.png?raw=true" style="width:50%; height:50%;">
				
				<br><br>This will control the <b> tempo </b> for all of our blocks within the program.
				
				<br><br>To help us remember that this changes all the blocks, a picture of a "globe" is shown!
				
				<br><br><b> Task: recreate the screenshot below. Then try changing the tempo to 400bpm, then try 50bpm. Can you hear the difference? </b>
				
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture7.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%">
				
				<br><br><b>NOTE: </b> You can also just use the end repeat block, which will repeat back to the start block (just like in standard music notation).
			</p>
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Tempo Change </h2>
		
			<p> 
				Allthough the global tempo is an easy way to control the speed of the entire music, sometimes we may want to change the tempo part way through our composition, or have 2 different tempo's happening at the same time.
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture10.png?raw=true" style="width:50%; height:50%;">
				<br><br>To do this we can use the tempo setter block (shown above). The blocks colour matches the global widget to help us remember. </br>
				<br><br>This works exactly like the global tempo, however, this changes the tempo at the point in time it is connected.
				<br><br><b>TASK: recreate the music shown in the image below and listen for the slow effect.</b>
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture11.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

		<h2> Steve Reich: Piano Phase </h2>

			<p> 
				Steve Reich is a contemporary composer, who writes music in a minimalistic style. 
				<br><br>Minimalism dosen't mean the music is boring and not much happens. It means that a single process is cleverly used to create a really cool and sophisticated effect from very little musical material. 
				<br><br>Piano phase is a good example of a simple minimalist process creating interesting music, from a small number of "blocks". 

				<br><br><iframe style="width:90%; height:90%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0LsjDe81wQ?rel=0&ampshowinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<br><br>The video above shows plays a rendition of Steve Reich's piano phase in Codetta. 

				<br><br>The piece is structed like so:
		
				 
				<ol>					
					<li> Reich has two lines of music playing the same phrase. </li>
					<li> He repeats this for a small amount of time. </li>
					<li> Then one of the two lines changes the tempo every so slightly.</li>
					<li> The entire process is repeated again </li>
				</ol>
						
			<p>
				To increment or decrement the tempo within Codetta, you can use the final block under time, the tempo changer. 
				<br><br><img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut2Images/picture12.png?raw=true" style="width:50%; height:50%;">
				<br><br>This will add the number specified to the current tempo. It can also move towards negative numbers for a gradual slowing of the tempo. 
				
				<br><br><b> Task: Make your own composiiton inspired by Piano Phase. Can you too repeat a small phrase and shift its tempo? </b>
				<br><br><b> The global tempo is set to 144. </b>
				<br><br>Below is a screenshot of piano phase to help you:
